> Large Language Models (LLMs) have become pervasive in everyday life, yet their inner workings remain opaque. While scholarly efforts have demonstrated LLMsâ€™ propensity to reproduce biases in their training data, they have primarily focused on the association of social groups with stereotypic attributes. In this paper, we extend this line of inquiry to investigate a bias akin to the social-psychological phenomenon where socially dominant groups are perceived to be less homogeneous than socially subordinate groups. We focus on the effect of group status on the homogeneity of group representations in LLMs, particularly in the context of race/ethnicity and gender. We had ChatGPT, a state-of-the-art LLM, generate a diversity of texts about intersectional group identities and measured text homogeneity. Across seven model specifications using BERT, RoBERTa, and Sentence-BERT, we consistently found that LLMs portray African, Asian, and Hispanic Americans as more homogeneous than White Americans and that they portray women as more homogeneous, but to a smaller extent. Finally, we found that the effect of gender differed across racial/ethnic groups such that the effect of gender was consistent within African and Hispanic Americans but not within Asian and White Americans. We speculate possible sources of this bias in LLMs and posit that the bias carries the potential to amplify biases in future LLM training and to reinforce stereotypes.
